# florapp

From this repository you can find my first mobile app. I use Expo Go to visualize my progress. 
The idea of ​​the app is to bring a tool to people who collect plants. With the help of this App, these people can easily store their current location with additional information in the database and thus manage the discovery locations of the found plants.
At the moment I have added Google map on it using google cloud services and API keys. Goal is to add there too some kind of database where users can add their locations. Overall this project is under development right now.

This project is connected directly to my personal Expo account so it needs access to it when running program. That's why working app is not possible to demo on your own device, only then when I log in to Expo.
